The challenge

Contamination from unexploded and abandoned weapons continues to kill and maim people, and block access to basic necessities for years, sometimes decades after the last shot is fired in an armed conflict. Determining the exact location of weapon contamination is a difficult task for clearance operators. The potential to use remote sensing and identify innovative solutions in the field of detection and clearance of explosive remnants of war using off-the-shelf technology remains largely unexplored. Improving the understanding of recent technology developments and how those can contribute to enhance humanitarian operations is the focus of this challenge.

The goal of the project is to secure operability between an aerial platform, camera unit and GPS recorder, and develop deep learning capable of distinguishing patterns of landmines and weapons. In a wider angle, the goal of the team is to understand how such technology can be applied to a broader humanitarian context.
